Equinox dialogue is a web-based dialogue tree builder for EquinoxEngine. It is built using React, please read the instructions below if you are a contributor.

What is "Equinox Engine"? It's something I'm working on that isn't quite ready to be open sourced yet!

# Usage

Build dialogue trees, when done click save or export. Save will serialize the entire tree + metadata whereas export will only export data needed by a game engine. This is tool is designed to work on a one NPC per tree system, so for each NPC you'll have a dedicated `.dlg` file. It does not currently support multiple NPCs in a single conversation.

## Keybinds

Limited copy/paste support is available through: `CTRL-C CTRL-V`

Delete nodes or connections with: `DEL`

Select multiple nodes by holding `SHIFT` and dragging with the left mouse button

# Roadmap
- Support for metadata conditionals (if quest completed -> unlocks dialogue subtree)
- Support for metadata
- Support for multiple NPCs in one conversation
- Autosaving
- ~~Electron app~~
- Exit node
- ~~Jump node and visible node IDs~~

# Building from source

I recommend using yarn but `npm run` works as well

To start a development server run...
```
yarn start
```

To build static files for production run...
```
yarn build
```

# Electron

To start the electron app in development mode run...
```
yarn electron:start
```

To package the electron app as an executable run...
```
yarn electron:package:<mac,win,linux>
```
Replacing `<mac,win,linux>` with your OS

# Sample Output
The following is sample JSON from an exported dialogue tree

```json
